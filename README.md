### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sam ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my profile!

## About Me ðŸ˜„
I am a full-stack web developer from Christchurch, New Zealand with a passion for all things software. I enjoy creating, learning about, and tinkering with code. Software development has always been something that's peaked my interest and in 2023 I made the decision to pursue it and Iâ€™ve havenâ€™t looked back.

## How Did I Get Here? ðŸ¤”
- My first taste of coding was an introduction to computer science paper in the final year of my finance degree at university. This gave me a taste for creating things with code and I was on the look out for opportunities to learn more.
- I singed up for Dev Academy Aotearoa and began the course in August 2023. From then until December 2023, I learnt everything I needed to know to create dynamic and functional web sites from front-end to back-end.

## What Am I Doing Now? ðŸ¤”
- My goal for the new year is to find a job in tech, where I can continue with my passion and feel the rush of creating new things.
- To keep the knowledge Iâ€™ve picked up over the last few months Iâ€™m continuing with a personal project of mine, a web-based, football team building game thatâ€™s currently under construction.
- I am always looking out for new things to learn. I plan to continue my journey with JavaScript, TypeScript and React and pick up new frameworks and languages in the future.
